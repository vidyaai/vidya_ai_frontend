# How Vidya AI Saves Professors 20+ Hours Per Week on Grading

*December 2024 • 5 min read*

## The Hidden Cost of Grading

Every professor knows the feeling: a stack of 120 assignments waiting to be graded, each requiring careful evaluation of student understanding, thoughtful feedback, and consistent scoring. According to research by the American Council on Education, professors spend **9–18 hours per week** just creating assignments and exams for a single course. Add to that the **25+ cumulative hours per week** that professors and teaching assistants spend grading for a class of 120 students, and you're looking at a significant portion of your workweek consumed by evaluation tasks.

This isn't just about time—it's about opportunity cost. Every hour spent grading is an hour not spent mentoring students, conducting research, developing innovative curriculum, or simply maintaining work-life balance. The question isn't whether grading is important; it's whether there's a smarter way to handle it.

## What If You Could Get Those Hours Back?

Imagine finishing your grading in 4 hours instead of 12. Imagine having AI-generated rubrics that ensure consistency across hundreds of submissions. Imagine your students receiving detailed, personalized feedback within minutes of submitting their work—not days or weeks later when the learning moment has passed.

With Vidya AI, professors are experiencing exactly this transformation. Our users report reducing question paper generation from 9 hours to **under 1 hour** (including revisions), and grading time from 12 hours to **under 4 hours** for complex multi-page assignments with scientific notations—for a class of 50 students.

## Real Benefits for Real Educators

### Spend More Time on High-Impact Teaching

When grading no longer dominates your schedule, you can focus on what drew you to academia in the first place. Use those reclaimed hours to hold more office hours, design engaging in-class activities, or finally tackle that research project that's been on hold.

### Ensure Fair, Consistent Evaluation

Human graders—even experienced ones—naturally drift in their standards over long grading sessions. An assignment graded at 8 AM might receive different feedback than one graded at midnight. Vidya AI applies the same rigorous criteria to every submission, eliminating grading fatigue and ensuring every student is evaluated fairly.

### Deliver Feedback That Actually Helps Students Learn

Fast feedback is effective feedback. When students receive detailed comments while the assignment is still fresh in their minds, they can immediately understand their mistakes and improve. Vidya AI provides comprehensive feedback to both professors and students, turning every assignment into a learning opportunity.

### Handle Complex Assignments with Ease

From multi-part engineering problems to essays with scientific notation, Vidya AI handles the complexity that makes manual grading so time-consuming. Support for images, diagrams, handwritten work, and typed PDFs means you're not limited in what you can assign.

## How It Works: Simple, Fast, Effective

Getting started with Vidya AI is straightforward. Upload your lecture notes or existing materials, specify the topics you want to cover and the difficulty level, and the AI generates a complete assignment—including questions, sample answers, and grading rubrics. You can review and edit anything before publishing. When students submit their work (typed or handwritten), AI grades each submission using your rubric and sends detailed feedback to both you and the student.

The entire process from assignment creation to graded feedback takes a fraction of the traditional time, without sacrificing quality or academic rigor.

## Who Benefits Most?

- **Large lecture professors** who face hundreds of submissions per assignment
- **STEM instructors** dealing with complex problem sets and calculations
- **Teaching assistants** who handle the bulk of grading workload
- **Adjunct faculty** balancing multiple courses with limited time
- **Any educator** who wants to spend less time grading and more time teaching

## The Bottom Line

Grading is necessary, but it doesn't have to consume your professional life. Vidya AI isn't about replacing the human element in education—it's about amplifying what human educators do best by handling the repetitive, time-consuming parts of evaluation.

Professors using Vidya AI report not just time savings, but improved job satisfaction. When you're not drowning in grading, you can be the educator you set out to be: engaged, innovative, and present for your students.
